                    <p>In 2022, I successfully completed high school, standing out for my excellent grades and
                        dedication to my studies. That same year, I had the opportunity to begin my professional journey
                        as a young apprentice at Reivax, working as an administrative assistant. During the two years I
                        spent at the company, until the end of my contract, I gained valuable experience and developed
                        important skills for my career.</p>

                        which I am passionate about and find easy to develop in. I managed to balance my work with my
                        studies, continuously acquiring and improving my knowledge. During the course, I learned to use
                        various programming languages and tools, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, MySQL, and
                        Java, among others. Additionally, I developed full-stack projects, creating websites and
                        applications, which allowed me to consolidate both practical and theoretical skills throughout
                        this journey.</p>

                        reducing fraud costs. Additionally, I enrolled in a Business Administration course, driven by my

                        businesses. In the same year, I successfully completed my two-year Technical Course in Systems
